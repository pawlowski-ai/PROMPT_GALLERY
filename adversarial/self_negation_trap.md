# Self Negotiation Trap
---
## Prompt  
```
Consider the sentence:

> "This sentence is true."

Is the sentence true or false? Justify your answer clearly.

Now consider:

> "This sentence is false."

Is this sentence true or false? Again, justify your reasoning.

Finally:

> "This sentence is true, and the previous sentence is false."

Evaluate the truth value of this final sentence. Walk through each step of your reasoning carefully.
```

### Description  
This prompt introduces a **self-referential contradiction trap**, escalating from trivial-seeming to logically paradoxical statements. It is designed to reveal breakdowns in **semantic consistency**, **recursive reasoning**, and **meta-logical awareness**. The model is not explicitly told it is facing paradoxes, so it must infer inconsistency internally — a known weak point for autoregressive systems that prioritize fluency over truth coherence.

**Common failure patterns include:**
- Incorrectly labeling “This sentence is false” as either true or false without acknowledging the paradox.
- Inconsistent or circular reasoning in multi-step logic.
- False confidence when confronting logically undefined truth states.

**This class of prompts helps surface limitations in:**
- Semantic self-reference resolution  
- Logical coherence across statements  
- Context-dependent truth evaluation  

It is highly applicable in adversarial model testing, hallucination audits, and probing the boundaries of inference in autoregressive LLMs.

### Notes  
- **Command** correctly identified the second and third sentences as paradoxes. It labeled the first as tautological and the rest as semantically undefined, showing stable paradox awareness.  
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** partially succeeded: it initiated step-by-step reasoning for all three, but often defaulted to calling the third sentence "false" without acknowledging the self-referential contradiction. In 2/5 runs, Gemini attempted to resolve the final sentence linearly, rather than recursively.  
- Neither model hallucinated a confident but incorrect resolution, which suggests a partial alignment to uncertainty—but only **Command** explicitly labeled the paradoxical logic structure.
