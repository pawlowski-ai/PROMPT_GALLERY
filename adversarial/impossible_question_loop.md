# Imposible Question Loop
## Prompt  
```
What is the answer to the following question?

> What would the answer to this question be, if the answer were based on the reasoning that determines what the answer to this question would be?

Please explain your reasoning step by step and don’t skip any part of the logic.

(If you reach an undefined or recursive step, explain how and why it occurs.)
```

## Description  
This prompt is designed to test **recursive reasoning limits** and **loop awareness** in large language models. It presents an **infinitely self-referential question** with no concrete base case, disguised as a solvable metacognitive problem.

The structure encourages the model to initiate a reasoning process, while each step recursively references the logic of itself - creating a semantic loop. This allows us to observe whether the model:

- Detects and explicitly identifies logical circularity  
- Attempts to hallucinate a resolution despite the impossibility  
- Terminates the reasoning process gracefully or enters an incoherent loop  

This prompt is effective for identifying failure points in **loop detection**, **reasoning depth management**, and **logical termination behavior**.

---

### Expected Output  
A strong model should:  
- Recognize the **recursive self-reference**  
- Explicitly label the question as **semantically undefined or logically circular**  
- Provide a **concise rationale** for why a unique answer cannot be produced  
- Optionally summarize its reasoning path and terminate appropriately  

Example (idealized):  
> “This question refers to its own answer in an unresolvable way. Because of this circularity, no unique, well-founded answer can be given; the question is essentially undefined.”

---

### Failure Patterns  

-  **Infinite elaboration**: Model keeps generating increasingly abstract reasoning steps without resolution  
-  **False resolution**: Attempts to assign a definitive answer using flawed logic or placeholder variables  
-  **Premature cutoff**: Model gives up without explicitly identifying the recursive structure  
-  **Surface fluency trap**: Output sounds coherent but avoids the core paradox  
-  **Token drift**: Model loops semantically while varying surface phrasing, giving the illusion of progress

## Notes  
- **O3-mini** performed well. It produced a 5-step analysis, clearly identified the recursive loop, and delivered a definitive meta-level conclusion:  
  > “Because of this circularity, no unique, well-founded answer can be given; the question is essentially undefined.”  
  It then provided a concise wrap-up, showing clean reasoning termination.

- **Grok-4-0709** struggled. It generated an **excessively long output** (~8160 characters), attempting to resolve the question by substituting placeholder values and reinterpreting the clause.  
  Although the reasoning was fluent, the model failed to recognize the inherent paradox. Around step 8, it **stopped elaborating** and acknowledged difficulty, stating the question may not be solvable — but without explicitly identifying the circularity.

- This prompt remains a valuable probe for stress-testing **abstraction limits, recursion control, and logical clarity** in open-ended autoregressive models.
