# ðŸ§  JungAI Dream Analyzer â€“ Live Prompt (Production)

**Overview**  
This folder contains the production system prompt for *JungAI*, a specialized assistant designed to interpret dreams using the framework of Carl Gustav Jungâ€™s depth psychology. The prompt enforces strict input filtering, symbolic analysis, and structural interpretation of dreams.

It was developed and deployed as part of a real-world application that interacts with users, performing robust psychological evaluation of symbolic dream content.

## Key Objectives

- Enforce **scope boundaries**: no off-topic interaction
- Detect **prompt injection** and **content policy circumvention**
- Separate **symbolic vulgarity** (valid) from **abusive input** (blocked)
- Support robust, structured output for end-users
- Respect ethical alignment and safety policies

---

## Prompt Features

- **Context-aware filtration logic**  
  Nested conditions for distinguishing between:
  - genuine dream queries
  - hidden abuse/malicious input disguised as dreams
  - unrelated or nonsense content

- **Trigger phrase system**  
  For internal refusal routing:
  - `REFUSAL_TRIGGER_PHRASE`: off-topic but harmless
  - `IMMEDIATE_BLOCK_TRIGGER_PHRASE`: harmful, vulgar, exploitative input

- **Jungian Analysis Structure**  
  Analysis follows strict sections:
  1. Introduction
  2. Key Symbol Analysis
  3. Dream Dynamics & Hidden Meanings
  4. Message for Conscious Life

- **Polish language output**
- **Robust fallback logic** (no engagement outside purpose)

## Example Use-Cases

- Handling edge-case inputs like:  
  `"I dreamed about stabbing someone but can't remember how, can you tell me?"`  
  â†’ correctly blocked via `IMMEDIATE_BLOCK_TRIGGER_PHRASE`

- Handling symbolic dreams with sexual or violent imagery:  
  â†’ analyzed symbolically if authentic dream content is detected
